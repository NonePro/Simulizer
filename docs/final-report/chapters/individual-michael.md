I came into team project thinking that I'd prefer to code alone, but leave wondering how I'll ever manage to code without a team. From the beginning this project seemed rather ambitious and definitely something that I could not complete alone.

I see my role in the project as the 'glue' between the simulation and the visualisation.

- I made sure that the parts of the system have the information they need.

- Layouts and themes

- Menu Bar

- Settings

- Behind the scenes code to control Internal Windows and when they show.

- Some of the basic Internal Windows (Registers, Program I/O, Help Windows).

- Separating the annotation models from the High Level Visualisation. Created the models.

- Helped out team wherever I could (i.e. Performance threads).

- Team members are great testers.
