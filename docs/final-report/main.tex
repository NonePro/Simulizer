\begin{abstract}
  In various Computer Science courses, students learn about processor architecture: how they are designed, how they execute instructions and also how you write assembly code to run on them. A common processor architecture to study is MIPS due to its reduced instruction set. While there are software systems that exist to allow the user to write and execute MIPS programs, they often lack useful features, making them unaccommodating to new users.

  In this project we aimed to extend the capabilities these systems, and additionally provide students with a unique, interactive, and visual way to learn the MIPS assembly language. This has been achieved by creating an IDE-like environment along with a range of visualisations to help with the learning process. In addition, Simulizer provides a visual way to describe difficult concepts, such as instruction pipelining, which opens the potential for the system to be used as a teaching resource.
