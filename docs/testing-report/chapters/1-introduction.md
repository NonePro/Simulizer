Introduction
============
This document is aimed at displaying the testing procedures carried out for the Simulizer software, created by team A4 for the team project at the University of Birmingham.

Test plan
---------
The plan for the testing of this software is to split it up into split it into different sections such that we can fully and comprehensively test our system with a high level of acceptance at the end of the project. The area of tests carried out will be as follows:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Comparison testing (Comparing our software's execution with that of existing software)
- Functional testing
- End-to-end testing
- User testing/evaluation

The unit testing will be carried out as we write the software, with many JUnit tests written for each component of the software (in isolation). The integration tests will concern us integrating the different components of our software together, for example, combining the assembler and simulation together and checking that they, together, can be used to correctly execute an assembly language program. Due to the fact that our aim in this project is to make a better, more usable alternative to existing software, we feel it is also a sensible idea to concern various outputs from our software with that of the existing software (Spimulator in this case). This will tell us whether we have at least reached the same level of quality/accuracy as the current software and, hopefully, tell us where we have made an improvement of some sort. The final area of our testing is user testing/evaluation. We are very fortunate to have a well defined set of users for this project and hence we intend to utilise this by getting opinions on our software and feedback from both a set of students taking the Computer Systems &amp; Architecture module, as well as the module lecturer, Ian Batten. Due to the agile nature of this project, we will able to do this continuously throughout the project, to give the best possible end product to our users.
