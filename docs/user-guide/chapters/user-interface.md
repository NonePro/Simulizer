# User Interface #
The user interface is designed to be as configurable as possible, so that the application can fulfil your needs. Don't need to visualise the internals of the CPU? Just close it. Need to make the editor a bit bigger? Then resize the editor. It's very simple.

## Menu Bar ##

## Internal Windows ##

## Layouts ##
Layouts determine the configuration that all the Internal Windows are in. They allow you to quickly switch between different arrangements to optimise your workflow.

### Loading a Layout ###

### Saving a Layout ###
If none of the included layouts are up to your standards then why not make your own. Add/Remove and rearrangement the Internal Windows until it is in a configuration that you are happy with. You can then save the layout by clicking Layouts $\to$ Save Layout.

$\TODO{image here}$

Enter a name for this new layout. In this case we called the layout `XXX`. Now click the save button and that new layout should show up on the Layouts drop down menu.
