Introduction
============
Thanks for downloading Simulizer! Simulizer is a piece of software that allows you simulate and visualize (hence Simulizer) the running of a MIPS processor
in the comfort of your own home. With Simulizer, you don't get to just run programs, you get to write and edit files with our own integrated text editor. As well as this, Simulizer provides a whole range of options to help you understand your MIPS code (and the processor) that little bit more. If you want to see your code moving through the CPU, then choose our CPU visualization! If you want to see your algorithm running to check you've got you logic correct then a high-level visualization is the option for you. If you've never been able to get your head round pipelining then nows your chance, Simulizer visualises that too!

Simulizer also provides you with loads of handy debugging tools, such as a logger for standard, error and debug streams, as well as windows to let you peak inside the memory/registers of the CPU. Another really clever thing included is a JavaScript based annotation system. Gone are the days of adding print statements throughout your code, instead you can put it in the comments. You can control the high level visualizations, as well as large amounts of the CPU in just a little bit of JavaScript!

Finally, enjoy your time using Simulizer!
