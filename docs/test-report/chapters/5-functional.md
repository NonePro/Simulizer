# Functional testing #

The functional tests will be non-automated. We will check that the system satisfies each individual functional requirement in the software requirements specification. The tests will largely be performed by physically using the system and checking that each requirement is satisfied.

*Not sure if this is needed here. Maybe more for usability testing.*
Our intended user base is split in two distinct parties: students of the Computer Systems & Architecture module, and the module lecturer. Since the students will not be very experienced with assembly language, and the module lecturer will not have a lot of time to spend on the software, we need to ensure that the requirements are satisfied *and* they are achieved for the appropriate audience.

For these tests, the description of each requirement will be stated, then we will give a brief overview of how it will be tested, and how we will ensure it is appropriate for our audience.
