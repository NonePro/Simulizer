Simulizer
=========

Simulizer is a piece of software designed to simulate and visualise the operation of a CPU with a simplified architecture.

Features
--------
- Provide a simple editor for a custom simplified assembly language (with a set of annotations to control the high-level algorithm visualisation).
- Provide a simulation and visualisation of an abstract simplified CPU.
- Provide ‘standard’ methods for displaying data found in other simulators.
- Provide controls for interacting with the simulation during execution such as changing the clock speed, pausing, allowing the user to write code, etc.
- Provide extra information upon interaction with the visualisation. For example tooltips which explain the functions of each component will appear when the user selects the component.
- Provide a high-level visualisation of annotated algorithms currently being run. ie at the level of data structures and structured loops such as for and while, dependent on the detail of the annotated source code.
