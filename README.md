Simulizer allows you to write assembly code and run it on a simulated and visualised CPU. It has been designed to improve various features of [SPIM](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net).

[Final report](https://github.com/mbway/Simulizer/raw/master/docs/Final-Report.pdf) (contains a more in depth description)

Features
--------
- A code editor with syntax highlighting for the MIPS language, along with real-time error checking and tooltips.
- Simulation and visualisation of an abstract simplified CPU.
- A window showing the values of the registers as programs are running.
- Interaction with the CPU, e.g. controlling the clock speed, pausing, stepping through execution, etc.
- Helpful messages and animations as the simulation is running to help the user understand how the CPU is operating.
- High-level visualisation of annotated programs, see below.

Annotations
-----------
You can add annotations in comments to signal the high-level visualisation. You can read the [annotation specification]() to learn how to use the annotations in your code.

High-Level Visualiation
-----------------------
The current data structures/graphics that can be visualised are:
- Lists
- Tower of Hanoi
